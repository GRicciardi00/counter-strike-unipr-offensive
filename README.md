# counter-strike-unipr-offensive
The idea comes from the passion of both of us for the well-known game Counter Strike Global Offensive and the full sharing of the thought "you only learn by having fun." by the French poet Anatole France.
The project is a top-down shooter multiplayer with client-server architecture, the server is an authoritative_server.
